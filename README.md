# Inaccurate Wallet Connection Check in Dapp

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dapps: incorrectly checking for wallet connection. The initial code only checks for the existence of the `ethereum` object, which isn't sufficient to confirm a connection.  The solution implements proper connection verification and error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code. It only checks if the `ethereum` object is present on the `window` object, rather than verifying the wallet's actual connection status and accounts.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation. It requests accounts from the Ethereum provider, handles potential errors (like the user rejecting the request), and confirms the connection status based on the successful retrieval of accounts.
